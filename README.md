CorelMate adds focused workflow tools to CorelDRAW while keeping CorelDRAW as the host application. It is built around a modular .NET architecture, a native-feeling WPF Docker, and a narrow CorelDRAW Object Model boundary.

## Current Status

CorelMate is an active pre-1.0 open-source project targeting CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2026, internal version 27.x.

Currently available:

- WPF Docker hosted through CorelDRAW's `FrameWork.AddDocker` API.
- Generic Badge Generator with `{{VARIABLE}}` placeholders, dynamic rows, quantities, millimeter layout, preview, and multi-page generation.
- Native Convert Text to Curves workflow for selected artistic and paragraph text.
- Host-independent smoke tests and a reproducible release ZIP workflow.

Still limited or unverified:

- Automatic `.addon` startup registration is not verified for .NET assemblies on v27.1.
- Full click-by-click Docker UI validation requires a foreground CorelDRAW session.
- Special containers, symbols, and text-on-path behavior need further testing.
- AI, Excel/CSV import, licensing, telemetry, and installer redesign are not part of the current release.

Do not use the pre-1.0 build for destructive artwork workflows without testing against a copy of the document.

## Features

### Badge Generator

Create one master badge in CorelDRAW, select it, and generate copies from manually entered data rows. The engine is generic and does not contain school-specific fields.

- Detects placeholders such as `{{TITLE}}` and `{{STANDARD}}` recursively through groups.
- Preserves the selected master by duplicating it through CorelDRAW's object model.
- Supports quantities, gaps, margins, page fitting, and additional pages.
- Keeps calculations in millimeters at the application boundary.
- Uses CorelDRAW command grouping so generation can be undone as one operation where supported.

### Convert Text to Curves

Preflights the current selection, reports convertible/locked/hidden text, asks for confirmation, and calls CorelDRAW's native `Shape.ConvertToCurves()` operation. Unrelated rectangles, images, and other vector objects are not flattened.

## Architecture

```text
CorelDRAW 2026
	|
	v
WPF CorelMate Docker
	|
	v
CorelMate.UI -> CorelMate.Host
					|-> CorelMate.Badges
					|-> CorelMate.Curves
					|-> CorelMate.Core
					|-> CorelMate.Infrastructure
					`-> CorelMate.AI (abstraction only)
```

| Project | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `CorelMate.Core` | Shared settings and domain concepts |
| `CorelMate.Badges` | Pure placeholders, data rows, layout, and page planning |
| `CorelMate.Curves` | Pure conversion summaries and Curves contracts |
| `CorelMate.Host` | CorelDRAW/VGCore COM adapter and document mutation |
| `CorelMate.UI` | WPF Docker and user workflows |
| `CorelMate.Infrastructure` | Logging and infrastructure seams |
| `CorelMate.AI` | Future provider abstraction; no network implementation |
| `CorelMate.Tests` | Dependency-free executable smoke tests |

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 x64
- CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2026, v27.1.0.129 tested locally
- .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack
- .NET SDK 10.0.103 or compatible SDK
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- CorelDRAW installed for host integration tests

The host project references Corel's installed assemblies through a machine-specific SDK path. Recheck `src/CorelMate.Host/CorelMate.Host.csproj` on another machine before building.

## Build And Test

```powershell
dotnet build .\CorelMate.sln -c Release
dotnet run --project .\tests\CorelMate.Tests\CorelMate.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

The smoke test covers pure placeholder, quantity, layout, and conversion-summary behavior. It does not replace a real CorelDRAW integration test.

## Development Docker

```powershell
dotnet build .\CorelMate.sln -c Release
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Install-Dev.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Uninstall-Dev.ps1
```

These scripts use COM automation and do not modify CorelDRAW installation files. Close CorelDRAW before rebuilding if it has loaded a Docker assembly and MSBuild reports a file lock.

## Release Package

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Build-Release.ps1
```

This creates `artifacts\CorelMate-0.1.0-docker.zip`. The package contains the WPF Docker and required managed CorelMate assemblies, plus package-local session install/remove scripts and a README. It excludes source, tests, PDBs, secrets, local paths, and Corel-owned interop assemblies.

Extract the ZIP and run `Install-CorelMate.ps1` or `Uninstall-CorelMate.ps1`. Automatic `.addon` startup is explicitly not claimed because the supported .NET startup mechanism is not verified for v27.1.
